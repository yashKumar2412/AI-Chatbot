# AI-Chatbot
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this assignment repository to display my work on using AI Chatbots to do Data Science projects. I used the [Medical Insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset) from Kaggle to explore an end-to-end data science project using CRISP-DM methodology, done entirely by an AI Assistant.

For a detailed understanding of the same, check out this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@yash.arunkumar/how-an-ai-assistant-used-crisp-dm-to-solve-data-science-problems-27df4d904608).

You can also view the ChatGPT-generated code compiled and run in this [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1riT1MOVl5QHTlO72fW1ObLnW3Gc_1Znt?usp=sharing) and the original [transcript](https://chatgpt.com/share/66f9cca2-9ff4-800d-832f-05e36d88c716).
